Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

In business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include:

* Age
* Gender
* Marital status
* Location (urban, suburban, rural)
* Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)

These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. This is because customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.
